THINGS TO BE AWARE OF IN USING BROWN-DERIVED ULFs FOR PARSER TRAINING
(Please let me know if you'd like me to do something about some of them):

NB:  I ADVISE USING FOR PARSER TRAINING ANY SENTENCES THAT
     - contain more than 30 words;
     - contain more than two occurrences of phrase types suffixed with
       "-1", "-2", ..., e.g., PP-1, PP-2, ..., PP-5; these are likely
       to involve rightmost phrases filling earlier gaps, as in
       "the Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition _
        or, more often, the sale _ of 764 chapels" 
   
     More filtering may be necessary to optimize training, as there
     may be Brown corpus files with "weird stuff" compared to our
     manually created training/testing corpora.

- "yesterday", "today" "next year", "last night", etc. are currently parsed as
   (ADV-E ({DURING}.P (K YESTERDAY.N~4))), etc., rather than
    yesterday.adv-e, etc. (which won't work for "last night", or
    "the day before", etc.)

- We're not dealing with things like "five years after the war",
  "shortly after the war" in the guidelines -- this requires forming
  a PP premodifier -- adv-a?? mod-pp??

- I've kept 'and' in its surface position for conjunctions of size > 2
  (ULF postprocessing to change to infix form is tricky; it could be
  done in phrase structure preprocessing, if desired)

- I've used ambiguous tense operator 'FIN' for auxiliaries like 'would',
  which can be PAST, PRES, and CF.

- In retrospect, the decision in the guidelines to treat modal "have to"
  as (have.v (Ka ...)) seems unfortunate; the motivation was that unlike
  other modals this can occur after another modal, as in "I will have to
  do it after all". But it's so close to "ought to" in meaning, it would
  be clearer as (have_to.aux-v ...). It also seems to have an S-level
  reading, as in "It surely has to rain soon." But I haven't acted on this...

- There's an odd little group of verbs where the infinitive denotes some 
  sort of emotion-evoking perception or thought. The infinitive seems part 
  of a tacit ADVP (but not a purpose-ADVP):
     {awake blanch blush exult shudder tremble}
  E.g.,  "He awoke to see a stranger stand by the tent"
     (This seems to mean something like, "He awoke and thereupon saw ...")
  E.g., "He blanched to see her so emaciated"
     (This seems to mean something like "He blanched at seeing her ...",
     and that also applies to the remaining verbs)
  Currently, these probably come out as purpose adverbials, i.e., in the form
  (adv-a ({for}.p (to ...)))

  Another odd type of infinitive adverbial is exemplified by "He retook the 
  exam, only to fail again" (perhaps meaning "with result ..."?). Again
  the current rules don't try to do justice to these uses.

- Adjective gaps in comparatives are coded as *adj, not *h; e.g., 
  "would have been sadder than it was" ==>
  ((FIN WOULD.AUX~27)
    (HAVE.AUX~28
     ((PERF BE.V~29)
      (SADDER.A~30 (THAN.PS~31 (IT.PRO~32 ((PAST BE.V~33) *ADJ)))))))

- Predeterminers are not addressed in the annotation guide, and Brown
  parses just do this:  (NP (PDT ALL) (DT THE) (NNS ...)), so the resulting
  ULF also comes out as (ALL.D THE.D (PLUR ...)). Ideally, we'd have a
  partitive structure here (all.d ((plur {member}.n) (of.p (the.d (plur ...)))))

- Speaking of PP[of], the ULFs produced here do not form hyphenated nominals
  like (part-of.n (the.d ...)), but rather (part.n (of.p (the.d ...)))

- The code may sometimes insert gaps where there aren't any -- I've fixed
  some of these cases (e.g., in relative clauses where the relative pronoun 
  is the subject) but probably not all.

- "as if" is rendered in Brown as (PP (IN AS) (SBAR (IN IF) (S ...))); I've
  changed what I got originally for some such cases, viz., (AS.P (IF.PS <WFF>)),
  to obtain (AS_IF.PS <WFF>), becaue "as if" feels like a single operator,
  taking a finite or subjunctive complement and forming a PP predicate that 
  can also function as an adverbial: "It seems as if the sky is/were falling";
  vs., "He walks as if he were drunk".
