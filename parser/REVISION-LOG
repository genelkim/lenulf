IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER  (since July 2021)

Apr 14/22

In "preprocessing-rules.lisp", *package-and-enclose-single-bracketed-phrases*
was edited & renamed *package-and-enclose-single-nonlexical-bracketed-phrases*
so that brackets around sungle lexical items, as in "...(been)..." won't
be retained.
================================================================
Apr 13/22

Stemming of "blitzes", "klutzes" corrected to give "blitz", "klutz"
(w/o final "e")
================================================================
Apr 12/22

I fixed the error that gave "is not a string designator" messages. 
The culprit was ![place-pp] in "tt-match-predicates.lisp" .
(I repaired the pred, adding a helper function)
=================================================================
Apr 8/22: slight modification to ![det-sing-standalone] and 
![det-plur-standalone] to allow for standalone NP "some", as in
"I made some" {coffee}, or "I see some" {stars}.
================================================================
Mar 30/22: Missing ![non-inf-taking-noun] definition inserted in 
"tt-match-predicates.lisp".
=================================================================
Last revisions Mar 12/22 -- many fixes, including ones for KA, ADV- etc.

For some known "issues", see README
=================================================================
Jan 31/22

The list of files being loaded by "init.lisp" has not changed.
But there have been numerous changes (not logged, alas) in rules
(e.g., in "preprocessing-rules.lisp" and "isa.lisp") and in various 
types of lexical information (e.g., in "transitivity-lists.lisp",
and "subcat-pref.lisp")

==================================================================
Sep 23/21

Various additions/revisions made to attempt distinuishing PP arguments,
PP predicates, and PP adverbials in verb phrases. Also infinitives in
verb phrases are made into (purpose) adverbials in certain cases .
E.g., consider
  "Bob feels UNDER THE WEATHER" (predicate)
  "Bob slept UNDER A TENT" (adverbial)
  "Bob talked TO ALICE" (argument)

  "Bob wants TO GRADUATE" (argument -- a kind of action)
  "Bob called Alice TO TELL HER THE GOOD NEWS" (purpose adverbial)

This effort depended very much on the information in the Alvey lexicon,
included here for the parts that were used

Much testing and refinement remains to be done, but I thought I'd make
this preliminary versio available.
===================================================================
Sep 3/21

The following rules were added:

(defrule *change-final-nnp-to-nn-after-initial-dt*
; e.g., "the Examiner" should come out as (the.d | Examiner|.n)
   '((NP (.DT !atom) *expr (NNP +expr)) (NP 2 3 (NN 4.2))))

(defrule *change-final-nnps-to-nns-after-initial-dt*
; e.g., "the Celts" should come out as (the.d (plur | Celt|.n))
   '((NP (.DT !atom) *expr (NNPS +expr)) (NP 2 3 (NNS 4.2))))

=================================================================
Sep 1-2/21

- Allowed s, m, re as forms of "be" (w/o initial apostrophe) in 'stem'

- Possessives without an 's' after apostrophe fixed, as in 
  "Willis' direction"

- disappearing sentences due to faulty 'simple-tree' fixed.

- defined 'insert-vp-gap-candidates' & fixed a bad return-from in it

- fixed faulty handling of complements of main verbs "be" and "become"
  (scrapped the removal of indefinite determiners in cases like
  "Bob is a student", & instead always using identity (like
    (= (a.det student.n))

- commented out unwanted debugging messages.

- some rule repairs/additions that I don't remember

=================================================================
Aug 28/21

- Added a couple of rules to eliminate any empty lists -- aimed at
  how they occur in some preprocessed versions, like David Ahn's,
  who seems to have simple deleted things like |``| or |''|, so that
  e.g., (|``| |``|) becomes ( ).

- Fixed a rule that illegally contained *h in the input pattern (where
  it would be interpreted as iteration of predicate !h), by changing
  this to !hole-var (hole veriable, true only of *h)

- Fixed the rule for changing (IN <atom>) premodifying a sentence to
  (PS <atom> so that it won't do that if the atom is 'taht'.
===================================================================
Aug 23-24/21

- Basic parenthesis handling added. Some bracketed NPs after NPs become
  appositives (w/o brackest); outermost sentence brackets are deleted.
  All others are kept, using (\( ... \)), as they can contribute
  various types of meanings.

- Some occurrences of *pseudo-attach* in the Brown corpus are dealt
  with; e.g., for "it"-extraposition, where 'it-extra.pro' is introduced.

- Various cases of temporal (supposed) nominals like "yesterday", 
  "next week" are transformed into adverbials, to yield ULFs like
  (adv-e ({during}.p (k yesterday.n))). It doesn't work uniformly yet.

- Multiple fronted PPs and temporal NPs are grouped together into a single
  adverbial, retaining separating commas -- because arguably such adverbials
  fill a single gap in the sentence being premodified. So the commas
  indicate concurrent application (like a conjunctive lambda-predicate,
  e.g., (:L t ((t ({during}.p | Today|)) and (t (at.p (k noon.n)))))

- additions/changes have been made to "preprocessing-rules.lisp",
  "tt-match-predicates.lisp", "isa.lisp", and comments in 
  "parse-tree-to-ulf.lisp"
=====================================================================
Aug 22/21

Rules added in "preprocessing-rules.lisp" for introducing bracketing of 
form (\" ... \") around probable mention-quotes, and deleting all others.
Corresponding feature 'say' added to "isa.lisp" for various "saying verbs"
(ones likely to be used before or after quoted utterances), and predicate
![quote] added to "tt-match-predicates.lisp" to match (|``| ...) or (|''| ...)
=======================================================================
Aug 20/21

Extensive revisions (in July & August) to allow for greater TT flexibility
(see README and "tt-syntax-documentation")

=======================================================================
July 4/21

- replaced parse.lisp and english-to-ulf.lisp with modifications by Gene
to allow use of either Allegro or sbcl.

- fixed absolute tt.lisp access path to be local.
========================================================================
