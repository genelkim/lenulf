;;
;; This file is is a revision of the way 'isa' works, so that the ETA pattern
;; matcher can be easily converted to using "dot-variables" (which will be
;; distinct from explicit word matches). 
;;
;; [The conversion will also require converting 'nil' in ETA input patterns
;; to !atom (or maybe something simpler like !1, !at or !ex, using a defpred).]
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; In ETA, features are specified as property lists of words and features.
;; Mapcar is applied to 'attachfeat' for each list of form (feat atm1 atm2 ...),
;;
;; In TT, we want to use hash tables to obtain all the features of a word.
;; Prior to the revisions here, 'isa' directly accessed features of a dot-
;; atom via a 'case' list, and checked if the atom being tested was on the
;; list; however, there were also 4 instances where a property was checked
;; via a hash table (in particular, argument-taking properties of verbs).
;;
;; The new method (like the ETA method) should allow for isa-chaining. 
;; However, some negative features like .NOT-DT needed to be converted
;; to !-predicates, like !not-dt.
;;
;; Suppose the general hash table is *isa-features*. Then in trying to match
;; a feature f specified as .f (i.e., prefixed with a '.') in a pattern
;; to an atom w [allow  expressions to have features as well??], we first
;; check if f = w, in which case the result is true; otherwise we look up
;; w in *isa-features*, and check if f is on the list of features  f1, f2, ...,
;; fk that we retrieve. If so, the match succeeds. If not, we go through
;; f1, f2, ..., fk, looking up each of them in *isa-features*, to see if f
;; appears in any of the features we retrieve for them. This is iterated.
;;
;; The isa-hierarchy is very unlikely to reach very high (and gets sparser
;; the higher we go), so this should be efficient enough. But we do have to
;; guard against circularity (as in ETA) because there's no requirement in
;; feature specification to avoid circularity (e.g., synonyms are by their
;; nature cicular). So we keep a list of features we have used for access
;; into *isa-features*, and don't look up any given feature a second time. 
;;
;; One question is whether it's worthwhile to somehow distinguish features
;; that have parents in the isa-hierarchy from those that don't. E.g., we
;; could use two separate lists for each feature entry, or we could mark
;; a "has-parent" property. But for now, the added programming complexity
;; doesn't seem worthwhile for the time that would be saved...
;;
;; Note: we also want features (specified in a pattern with a dot) to match
;; themselves. E.g., specifying '.doctor' in a pattern should match 'doctor',
;; not only 'surgeon', 'podiatrist', etc. Do we always want this? ETA assumes
;; yes (a feature is just closely related to the words with that feature, 
;; and as such certainly related to themselves), but what if we want to use
;; feature categories, e.g., would we want '.name' to match word 'name'?
;; And would we want '.expletive' to match 'expletive'? I think a reasonable
;; answer is that if we don't want that match, we should instead use 
;; !-predicates, e.g., '!name', '!expletive', which also has the advantage
;; of allowing iteration, e.g., '?name', '*name', '+name', '?expletive', etc.
;; I think we still want to allow categories as isa-features, e.g., POS's
;; like 'aux', but keeping in mind that this will also match 'aux' appearing
;; in text.

(defun isa (x feat) ; briefly tested July 27/21
;``````````````````
; x:    a symbol (e.g., 'surgeon' or 'doctor')
; feat: another symbol (e.g., 'professional'). In general, there is
;       no clear presumed logical relation between x and feat -- feat
;       simply "indicates" the sort of thing x refers to, in some sense.
;
; NB: an atom is always assumed to have itself as a feature; e.g., 
;     (isa 'this 'this) is true. So using '.occupation' in a pattern
;     will match 'occupation', even if the pattern coder wrote down
;       (occupation physicist cobbler poet teacher ...)
;     with the intention of using '.occupation' to match 'physicist', etc.,
;     in a sentence like "Alice is a physicist", and concluding "Alice
;     is employed". The sentence "Computer programming is an occupation"
;     would then likewise lead to the conclusion "Computer programming is
;     employed"! The moral is, if you want to use a match-predicate that
;     is true of various expressions but not itself, define it as a
;     !predicate rather than a feature.
;
; Method:
;     Look up x in the *isa-features* hash table and see if feat appears in the
;     retrieved list or in the lists (in the same table) associated with the
;     retrieved features, etc., while guarding against loops. Return T if 
;     the feature is found and NIL otherwise. Case is ignored. Both x and
;     feat are allowed to be dot-atoms (i.e., preceded by a dot), but the
;     dot(s) are stripped away before the hash-table lookup is done.
;     (Dot-atoms just serve to indicate to the matcher to do an isa-test.)

; DOT-ATOMS .<FEATURE>: Can be viewed as pred's, for matching specific atoms
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
; But they don't allow for !/?/*/+ forms; a dot-predicate is satisfied iff
; there is an isa-path from the word being matched to the feature after
; the dot in the dot-atom. The dot-atom repertoire can be freely expanded.
;
; NB: 'isa' as defined above ensures that a dot-atom predicate is always
;     true of the atom following the dot (this is case-insensitive).
;
; The feature assignments explicitly enumerated here are for features that
; don't apply to more than about a dozen atoms. For ones applying to large
; numbers of atoms, we use separate statements below, that refer to named
; global lists containing those atoms.
;
; I also considered a special notation in TT for feature negation, e.g.,
; -.NP (doesn't have feature .NP), but decided for now this isn't
; tremendously useful, as we can also use defpred, e.g., 
;    (defpred !-NP x (not (isa x '.NP)))
; or, if we don't think the variants ?-NP, *-NP, +-NP will be needed,
;    (defun !-NP (x) (not (isa x '.NP)))
; Currently, the negative !-preds, defined via the 'defpred' macro, use
; !non- or !not- at the beginning of their names.

;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; Heuristically test whether `noun' (a singular noun, as an atom) is likely
; to be an event noun. Many nouns ending in -sion, -tion, -al, -ance, -ment
; are event nouns, but there are many event nouns with different endings,
; e.g., accident, adventure, ambush, etc., and many nouns with -sion, ...,
; -ment endings are not event nouns, e.g., tension, corral, chance, cement,
; etc. We first identify event nouns not ending in -sion, ..., -ment,
; then return nil for non-event nouns with such endings, and then accept
; any remaining noun ending in -sion, -tion, -al, -ance, -ment as an event
; noun. Obviously, refinements would definitely be possible.
; 
; A difficulty is that many nouns are ambiguous between event and
; non-event nouns in a fairly balanced way, e.g., "in the injury",
; "in the exhibit", "at its foundation", "before the conclusion".
;
; Note: in PPs with prepositions {during, till, until} we assume we
;       we have an event PP; for {after, before, at, in, up_to} we check
;       for an event noun. e.g., we exclude "He ran after the dog"; 
;       "He stood before the door" from event-PPs.)
