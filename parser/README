Version 2 of the English-to-ULF parser, and new version of TT; June 19/21
=================================================================

The main ULF-derivation programs are in "parse-tree-to-ulf.lisp"

After doing
  (load "init.lisp"),
the 'parse-tree-to-ulf' function can be used.

The easiest way to try the ULF parser is copy the definition of the
'ulf' function that is offered to the user when "init.lisp" is loaded,
and to try things like (ulf "This is a test.")

The parser is in verbose mode by default, showing the rules it tries;
To quiet it down, use (setq *show-stages* nil).

The lexical-level ULF derivation code is in 
   pos+word-to-ulf.lisp
This also requires loading of "stem.lisp" (a variant of previous versions)

The tree transduction code is in "tt.lisp"

TT-predicates are in "tt-match-predicates.lisp".

The tree preprocessing code is in 
   "preprocess-tree-for-ulf.lisp".

ULF postprocessing remains remains minimal and may never get expanded
(processing at the parse tree level is generally easier, as the "types"
like NP and VP are apparent, whereas in ULF they're not explicit except
for the dot-suffixes at the atomic level).

I have in mind a way of speeding up sequential rule application significantly,
apart from compiling, but this hasn't been the highest priority.

"tt-syntax-documentation" provides the syntactic essentials of TT.
But you don't need to know this to do ULF derivation. But here are
some quick notes for potential users of TT. (The next version of TT will
be usable for ETA, allowing fairly easy replacement of the ETA match
language and code.)

The 'match' function finds rightmost matches (while TTT finds leftmost 
matches), but that could fairly easily be changed. Rightmost matches 
are better when "soft variables" (ones allowing binding to the empty 
sequence, coded as (:seq)) are more likely to remain empty than being 
filled.

TT combines elements of TTT (e.g., using characters ?, !, *, + in predicates
that respectively match at most one expression, exactly one, 0 or more,
or at least one expression) and the ETA matching language, using numeric
indices to identify constituents (elements or sequences) of an expression,
to be used in assembling a transformed expression. TT goes further
than the language in ETA, allowing not only 1, 2, 3, ... as indices of
top-level list elements, but also 1.1, 1.2, ..., 2.1, 2.2, ... for 
second-level parts, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ..., 2.1.1, 2.1.2, ... etc. for 3rd-
level elements, etc.

TT has no sticky variables, so bindings at diffeent tree locations can't 
be checked for identity (this would have to be done separately), but we can 
still "get at" any arbitrarily deeply nested part of a match (via the above
indices) and use these parts (expressions or expression sequences) any
way we want in the reassembly templates.
