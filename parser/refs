VerbAtlas 1.0 - Semantic Role Labeling and beyond!

We
 are proud to announce that VerbAtlas

 1.0 (http://verbatlas.org)

 is finally available for download at http://verbatlas.org/download.
 Developed in the Sapienza NLP
 group (http://nlp.uniroma1.it),
 the multilingual Natural Language Processing research team at the Sapienza 
University of Rome, VerbAtlas is a novel large-scale manually-crafted semantic 
resource for wide-coverage, intelligible and scalable Semantic Role Labeling.

 The goal of VerbAtlas is to manually cluster WordNet synsets that share similar 
semantics into sets of semantically-coherent frames. The main features are:

    466
     semantically-coherent frames using 26 cross-frame VerbNet-inspired
     semantic roles for their argument structure.

    Available both for download and via RESTful API.

    Full coverage of WordNet 3.0 verb synsets (13,000+).

    Complete linkage to BabelNet 4.0, which supports 280+ languages 
    (new version to come later this year!).

    Manual mapping to PropBank of all CoNLL-2009 and CoNLL-2012 dataset 
    occurrences (5000+ mappings).


    Selectional preferences: the superconcept most probably associated with 
    a semantic role in a frame (e.g. food for the patient role of the EAT frame).

    Default/shadow
     arguments: arguments logically implied or already incorporated into a verb.

    Implicit arguments: arguments that are implicit in the argument structure 
    of a verb.

And much more! Please check out our EMNLP 2019 paper:

A.  Di Fabio, S. Conia, R. Navigli “VerbAtlas: a Novel Large-Scale Verbal Semantic 
Resource and Its Application to Semantic Role Labeling”, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, 
pp. 627-637 

and
http://verbatlas.org

 for more details!

A state-of-the-art span-based SRL system which uses VerbAtlas and PropBank jointly is also available from the same website (just type a sentence!).

VerbAtlas is an output of the MOUSSE ERC Consolidator Grant n. 726487 and the 
ELEXIS project no.731015.  Babelscape proudly developed the online interface 
and API, provides the infrastructure for maintaining the service and works on 
the improvement of the resource. 

Enjoy!
